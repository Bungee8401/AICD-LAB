short channel effect -> calculated gm smaller than expected
	also, even in saturation, there's weak, moderate, strong inversion

1 OPAMP schematic 

explain each parts, what they do 
	P325 - 367
	
1.1 bias circuit

current mirror, cascode current mirror -> channel length modulation

1.2 resistor, zero and poles. zero resistor 
	
which one is main pole? why dont cancel the other?  -> zero resistor cant be too large

1.3 opamp parameter tuning

DC gain = 1, horizontal axis is GBW

M6 W/L increase, corner fail, why?

1.4 layout

why common centroid layout -> differential input pairs 



2. BGR

2.1 start-up circuit

cant find where to connnect -> 

resistor // NMOS -> smaller resistor to consume some voltage

2.2 PSRR

three filter circuit

NMOS before Rin1 Rin2 -> saturation region, capacitor

PSRR why DC gain is related
